<p>This the Javadoc description of the FidoCadJ source code.</p>
<p>Information given here is quite technical, you probably may be interested to it only if you wish to study or modify the FidoCadJ source code. You may do that for your own leisure or for improving it.</p>
<p>Probably, the best place where to start is from the main method, which is located inside the FidoMain class in the net.sourceforge.fidocadj package.
</p>
<p>If you are more interested about the low level drawing operations, you may have a look at the classes in the net.sourceforge.fidocadj.primitives package. There is a class for each graphical element you can employ in FidoCadJ.
</p>
<p>If you want to see the code related to the export towards vector graphic format, have a look at the net.sourceforge.fidocadj.export package.
</p>
<p>The code related to the editing operations is contained in the net.sourceforge.fidocadj.circuit package and it is organized more or less following a model/view/controller approach. The name of the sub-packages should be self-explicative, as much as possible.
